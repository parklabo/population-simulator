# Population Crisis Simulator

> A wake-up call dashboard visualizing the global demographic crisis through real-time birth rate simulations

## 🚨 The Crisis We Face

As someone living in Japan as a Korean, I was shocked to discover that South Korea and Japan rank **#1** and **#8** respectively among countries with the lowest birth rates globally:

- 🇰🇷 **South Korea**: 0.72 births per woman (World's lowest)
- 🇯🇵 **Japan**: 1.26 births per woman

This isn't just an Asian problem. The demographic crisis spans across continents:
- 🇭🇰 Hong Kong: 0.77
- 🇸🇬 Singapore: 0.85
- 🇮🇹 Italy: 1.20
- 🇪🇸 Spain: 1.16
- 🇩🇪 Germany: 1.49

**The replacement rate needed to maintain population is 2.1 births per woman.**

## 📊 Project Purpose

This project was born from a personal shock at seeing these statistics. The goal is to:

1. **Raise Awareness**: Create an impactful visualization that makes the demographic crisis tangible
2. **Enable Easy Sharing**: Build a dashboard that can be easily shared to spread awareness
3. **Simulate Futures**: Show potential demographic outcomes based on current trends
4. **Inspire Action**: Help people understand the urgency of this global challenge

## 🌍 Why This Matters

The demographic crisis affects:
- **Economic Sustainability**: Shrinking workforce, increasing elderly care costs
- **Social Security Systems**: Fewer workers supporting more retirees
- **Innovation and Growth**: Declining young population impacts innovation
- **National Security**: Population decline affects military and economic power
- **Cultural Continuity**: Communities and traditions at risk of disappearing

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Simulation**: Watch population changes based on different birth rate scenarios
- **Country Comparison**: Compare demographic trends across nations
- **Future Projections**: See population pyramids for 2030, 2050, and beyond
- **Impact Visualization**: Understand economic and social implications
- **Shareable Reports**: Generate and share demographic impact reports

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15**: React framework for production
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive design
- **D3.js/Recharts**: Data visualization (planned)
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform

## 🎯 Mission

To create a powerful, accessible tool that helps people understand the demographic crisis we're facing. By making these abstract numbers visual and personal, we hope to inspire conversations, policy changes, and individual decisions that can help address this global challenge.
